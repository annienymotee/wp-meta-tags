Wordpress Meta Tags

### Purpose
When interacting with social networks, it's vital that your top page meta tags properly link your blog to your social networks. This enables you to simply write a blog article and then post only the URL to your article on your social networks. Each social network will grab your content from your meta tags and build the social post for you. It's a good idea to add your hash tags to your social post, and at the bottom of your blog post.

### Blog Post Format
When writing your blog post, be sure the only thing you have at the top is a \<h2\> header and the start of your post content. This is the best practice for search engine optimization, and these social meta tags. Put your hash tags at the bottom of your blog post for additional reach.

### Update Suggestions
If you see where an improvement can be made to this code, please share. In my testing, I found this to be the most effective way to get properly formatted social meta tag content for any Wordpress website.

Thank you!
